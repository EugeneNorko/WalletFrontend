Hello! ðŸ‘‹

This application is called Wallet. It exists to make it easier to control your own finances.
The frontend is built on React and the backend is built on Node.js.

So what do we have?
All starts with the registration/login form. 
The form is validated with Yup on the frontend and Joi on the backend.

After login, we see:
Logout button,
Navigation for easy transition between pages,
The funds we have in the wallet,
Online currency exchange rate,
And beautiful green Add transaction button!

By clicking the green button, we see a dynamic, convenient form for adding expenses or income to our wallet!

There are also two main pages. 
Home - a page with the history of our actions, there is a convenient pagination for navigation

Statistics - a page with statistics, with a nice animated circle showing expenses by category. There is a filter by month.
